/* parser generated by jison 0.6.0-193 */

/*
 * Returns a Parser object of the following structure:
 *
 *  Parser: {
 *    yy: {}     The so-called "shared state" or rather the *source* of it;
 *               the real "shared state" `yy` passed around to
 *               the rule actions, etc. is a derivative/copy of this one,
 *               not a direct reference!
 *  }
 *
 *  Parser.prototype: {
 *    yy: {},
 *    EOF: 1,
 *    TERROR: 2,
 *
 *    trace: function(errorMessage, ...),
 *
 *    JisonParserError: function(msg, hash),
 *
 *    quoteName: function(name),
 *               Helper function which can be overridden by user code later on: put suitable
 *               quotes around literal IDs in a description string.
 *
 *    originalQuoteName: function(name),
 *               The basic quoteName handler provided by JISON.
 *               `cleanupAfterParse()` will clean up and reset `quoteName()` to reference this function
 *               at the end of the `parse()`.
 *
 *    describeSymbol: function(symbol),
 *               Return a more-or-less human-readable description of the given symbol, when
 *               available, or the symbol itself, serving as its own 'description' for lack
 *               of something better to serve up.
 *
 *               Return NULL when the symbol is unknown to the parser.
 *
 *    symbols_: {associative list: name ==> number},
 *    terminals_: {associative list: number ==> name},
 *    nonterminals: {associative list: rule-name ==> {associative list: number ==> rule-alt}},
 *    terminal_descriptions_: (if there are any) {associative list: number ==> description},
 *    productions_: [...],
 *
 *    performAction: function parser__performAction(yytext, yyleng, yylineno, yyloc, yystate, yysp, yyvstack, yylstack, yystack, yysstack),
 *
 *               The function parameters and `this` have the following value/meaning:
 *               - `this`    : reference to the `yyval` internal object, which has members (`$` and `_$`)
 *                             to store/reference the rule value `$$` and location info `@$`.
 *
 *                 One important thing to note about `this` a.k.a. `yyval`: every *reduce* action gets
 *                 to see the same object via the `this` reference, i.e. if you wish to carry custom
 *                 data from one reduce action through to the next within a single parse run, then you
 *                 may get nasty and use `yyval` a.k.a. `this` for storing you own semi-permanent data.
 *
 *                 `this.yy` is a direct reference to the `yy` shared state object.
 *
 *                 `%parse-param`-specified additional `parse()` arguments have been added to this `yy`
 *                 object at `parse()` start and are therefore available to the action code via the
 *                 same named `yy.xxxx` attributes (where `xxxx` represents a identifier name from
 *                 the %parse-param` list.
 *
 *               - `yytext`  : reference to the lexer value which belongs to the last lexer token used
 *                             to match this rule. This is *not* the look-ahead token, but the last token
 *                             that's actually part of this rule.
 *
 *                 Formulated another way, `yytext` is the value of the token immediately preceeding
 *                 the current look-ahead token.
 *                 Caveats apply for rules which don't require look-ahead, such as epsilon rules.
 *
 *               - `yyleng`  : ditto as `yytext`, only now for the lexer.yyleng value.
 *
 *               - `yylineno`: ditto as `yytext`, only now for the lexer.yylineno value.
 *
 *               - `yyloc`   : ditto as `yytext`, only now for the lexer.yylloc lexer token location info.
 *
 *                               WARNING: since jison 0.4.18-186 this entry may be NULL/UNDEFINED instead
 *                               of an empty object when no suitable location info can be provided.
 *
 *               - `yystate` : the current parser state number, used internally for dispatching and
 *                               executing the action code chunk matching the rule currently being reduced.
 *
 *               - `yysp`    : the current state stack position (a.k.a. 'stack pointer')
 *
 *                 This one comes in handy when you are going to do advanced things to the parser
 *                 stacks, all of which are accessible from your action code (see the next entries below).
 *
 *                 Also note that you can access this and other stack index values using the new double-hash
 *                 syntax, i.e. `##$ === ##0 === yysp`, while `##1` is the stack index for all things
 *                 related to the first rule term, just like you have `$1`, `@1` and `#1`.
 *                 This is made available to write very advanced grammar action rules, e.g. when you want
 *                 to investigate the parse state stack in your action code, which would, for example,
 *                 be relevant when you wish to implement error diagnostics and reporting schemes similar
 *                 to the work described here:
 *

 *
 *               - `yyrulelength`: the current rule's term count, i.e. the number of entries occupied on the stack.
 *
 *                 This one comes in handy when you are going to do advanced things to the parser
 *                 stacks, all of which are accessible from your action code (see the next entries below).
 *
 *               - `yyvstack`: reference to the parser value stack. Also accessed via the `$1` etc.
 *                             constructs.
 *
 *               - `yylstack`: reference to the parser token location stack. Also accessed via
 *                             the `@1` etc. constructs.
 *
 *                             WARNING: since jison 0.4.18-186 this array MAY contain slots which are
 *                             UNDEFINED rather than an empty (location) object, when the lexer/parser
 *                             action code did not provide a suitable location info object when such a
 *                             slot was filled!
 *
 *               - `yystack` : reference to the parser token id stack. Also accessed via the
 *                             `#1` etc. constructs.
 *
 *                 Note: this is a bit of a **white lie** as we can statically decode any `#n` reference to
 *                 its numeric token id value, hence that code wouldn't need the `yystack` but *you* might
 *                 want access this array for your own purposes, such as error analysis as mentioned above!
 *
 *                 Note that this stack stores the current stack of *tokens*, that is the sequence of
 *                 already parsed=reduced *nonterminals* (tokens representing rules) and *terminals*
 *                 (lexer tokens *shifted* onto the stack until the rule they belong to is found and
 *                 *reduced*.
 *
 *               - `yysstack`: reference to the parser state stack. This one carries the internal parser
 *                             *states* such as the one in `yystate`, which are used to represent
 *                             the parser state machine in the *parse table*. *Very* *internal* stuff,
 *                             what can I say? If you access this one, you're clearly doing wicked things
 *
 *               - `...`     : the extra arguments you specified in the `%parse-param` statement in your
 *                             grammar definition file.
 *
 *    table: [...],
 *               State transition table
 *               ----------------------
 *
 *               index levels are:
 *               - `state`  --> hash table
 *               - `symbol` --> action (number or array)
 *
 *                 If the `action` is an array, these are the elements' meaning:
 *                 - index [0]: 1 = shift, 2 = reduce, 3 = accept
 *                 - index [1]: GOTO `state`
 *
 *                 If the `action` is a number, it is the GOTO `state`
 *
 *    defaultActions: {...},

 *
 *    constructParseErrorInfo: function(error_message, exception_object, expected_token_set, is_recoverable),
 *               Helper function **which will be set up during the first invocation of the `parse()` method**.
 *               Produces a new errorInfo 'hash object' which can be passed into `parseError()`.
 *               See it's use in this parser kernel in many places; example usage:
 *
 *                   var infoObj = parser.constructParseErrorInfo('fail!', null,
 *                                     parser.collect_expected_token_set(state), true);
 *                   var retVal = parser.parseError(infoObj.errStr, infoObj, parser.JisonParserError);
 *
 *    originalParseError: function(str, hash, ExceptionClass),
 *               The basic `parseError` handler provided by JISON.
 *               `cleanupAfterParse()` will clean up and reset `parseError()` to reference this function
 *               at the end of the `parse()`.
 *
 *    options: { ... parser %options ... },
 *
 *    parse: function(input[, args...]),
 *               Parse the given `input` and return the parsed value (or `true` when none was provided by
 *               the root action, in which case the parser is acting as a *matcher*).
 *               You MAY use the additional `args...` parameters as per `%parse-param` spec of this grammar:
 *               these extra `args...` are added verbatim to the `yy` object reference as member variables.
 *
 *               WARNING:
 *               Parser's additional `args...` parameters (via `%parse-param`) MAY conflict with
 *               any attributes already added to `yy` by the jison run-time; 
 *               when such a collision is detected an exception is thrown to prevent the generated run-time 
 *               from silently accepting this confusing and potentially hazardous situation!
 *
 *               The lexer MAY add its own set of additional parameters (via the `%parse-param` line in 
 *               the lexer section of the grammar spec): these will be inserted in the `yy` shared state
 *               object and any collision with those will be reported by the lexer via a thrown exception.
 *
 *    cleanupAfterParse: function(resultValue, invoke_post_methods, do_not_nuke_errorinfos),
 *               Helper function **which will be set up during the first invocation of the `parse()` method**.
 *               This helper API is invoked at the end of the `parse()` call, unless an exception was thrown
 *               and `%options no-try-catch` has been defined for this grammar: in that case this helper MAY
 *               be invoked by calling user code to ensure the `post_parse` callbacks are invoked and
 *               the internal parser gets properly garbage collected under these particular circumstances.
 *
 *    yyMergeLocationInfo: function(first_index, last_index, first_yylloc, last_yylloc, dont_look_back),
 *               Helper function **which will be set up during the first invocation of the `parse()` method**.
 *               This helper API can be invoked to calculate a spanning `yylloc` location info object.
 *
 *               Note: %epsilon rules MAY specify no `first_index` and `first_yylloc`, in which case
 *               this function will attempt to obtain a suitable location marker by inspecting the location stack
 *               backwards.

 * The `parseError` function receives a 'hash' object with these members for lexer and
 * parser errors:
 *
 *  {
 *    text:        (matched text)
 *    token:       (the produced terminal token, if any)
 *    token_id:    (the produced terminal token numeric ID, if any)
 *    line:        (yylineno)
 *    loc:         (yylloc)
 *  }
 *
 * parser (grammar) errors will also provide these additional members:
 *
 *  {
 *    expected:    (array describing the set of expected tokens;
 *                  may be UNDEFINED when we cannot easily produce such a set)
 *    state:       (integer (or array when the table includes grammar collisions);
 *                  represents the current internal state of the parser kernel.
 *                  can, for example, be used to pass to the `collect_expected_token_set()`
 *                  API to obtain the expected token set)
 *    action:      (integer; represents the current internal action which will be executed)
 *    new_state:   (integer; represents the next/planned internal state, once the current
 *                  action has executed)
 *    recoverable: (boolean: TRUE when the parser MAY have an error recovery rule
 *                  available for this particular error)
 *    state_stack: (array: the current parser LALR/LR internal state stack; this can be used,
 *                  for instance, for advanced error analysis and reporting)
 *    value_stack: (array: the current parser LALR/LR internal `$$` value stack; this can be used,
 *                  for instance, for advanced error analysis and reporting)
 *    location_stack: (array: the current parser LALR/LR internal location stack; this can be used,
 *                  for instance, for advanced error analysis and reporting)
 *    yy:          (object: the current parser internal "shared state" `yy`
 *                  as is also available in the rule actions; this can be used,
 *                  for instance, for advanced error analysis and reporting)
 *    lexer:       (reference to the current lexer instance used by the parser)
 *    parser:      (reference to the current parser instance)
 *  }
 *
 * while `this` will reference the current parser instance.
 *
 * When `parseError` is invoked by the lexer, `this` will still reference the related *parser*
 * instance, while these additional `hash` fields will also be provided:
 *
 *  {
 *    lexer:       (reference to the current lexer instance which reported the error)
 *  }
 *
 * When `parseError` is invoked by the parser due to a **JavaScript exception** being fired
 * from either the parser or lexer, `this` will still reference the related *parser*
 * instance, while these additional `hash` fields will also be provided:
 *
 *  {
 *    exception:   (reference to the exception thrown)
 *  }
 *
 * Please do note that in the latter situation, the `expected` field will be omitted as
 * this type of failure is assumed not to be due to *parse errors* but rather due to user
 * action code in either parser or lexer failing unexpectedly.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * You can specify parser options by setting / modifying the `.yy` object of your Parser instance.
 * These options are available:
 *
 * ### options which are global for all parser instances
 *
 *  Parser.pre_parse: function(yy)
 *                 optional: you can specify a pre_parse() function in the chunk following
 *                 the grammar, i.e. after the last `%%`.
 *  Parser.post_parse: function(yy, retval, parseInfo) { return retval; }
 *                 optional: you can specify a post_parse() function in the chunk following
 *                 the grammar, i.e. after the last `%%`. When it does not return any value,
 *                 the parser will return the original `retval`.
 *
 * ### options which can be set up per parser instance
 *
 *  yy: {
 *      pre_parse:  function(yy)
 *                 optional: is invoked before the parse cycle starts (and before the first
 *                 invocation of `lex()`) but immediately after the invocation of
 *                 `parser.pre_parse()`).
 *      post_parse: function(yy, retval, parseInfo) { return retval; }
 *                 optional: is invoked when the parse terminates due to success ('accept')
 *                 or failure (even when exceptions are thrown).
 *                 `retval` contains the return value to be produced by `Parser.parse()`;
 *                 this function can override the return value by returning another.
 *                 When it does not return any value, the parser will return the original
 *                 `retval`.
 *                 This function is invoked immediately before `parser.post_parse()`.
 *
 *      parseError: function(str, hash, ExceptionClass)
 *                 optional: overrides the default `parseError` function.
 *      quoteName: function(name),
 *                 optional: overrides the default `quoteName` function.
 *  }
 *
 *  parser.lexer.options: {
 *      pre_lex:  function()
 *                 optional: is invoked before the lexer is invoked to produce another token.
 *                 `this` refers to the Lexer object.
 *      post_lex: function(token) { return token; }
 *                 optional: is invoked when the lexer has produced a token `token`;
 *                 this function can override the returned token value by returning another.
 *                 When it does not return any (truthy) value, the lexer will return
 *                 the original `token`.
 *                 `this` refers to the Lexer object.
 *
 *      ranges: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> token location info will include a .range[] member.
 *      flex: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> flex-like lexing behaviour where the rules are tested
 *                 exhaustively to find the longest match.
 *      backtrack_lexer: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> lexer regexes are tested in order and for invoked;
 *                 the lexer terminates the scan when a token is returned by the action code.
 *      xregexp: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> lexer rule regexes are "extended regex format" requiring the
 *                 `XRegExp` library. When this `%option` has not been specified at compile time, all lexer
 *                 rule regexes have been written as standard JavaScript RegExp expressions.
 *  }

 * Returns a Lexer object of the following structure:
 *
 *  Lexer: {
 *    yy: {}     The so-called "shared state" or rather the *source* of it;
 *               the real "shared state" `yy` passed around to
 *               the rule actions, etc. is a direct reference!
 *
 *               This "shared context" object was passed to the lexer by way of 
 *               the `lexer.setInput(str, yy)` API before you may use it.
 *
 *               This "shared context" object is passed to the lexer action code in `performAction()`
 *               so userland code in the lexer actions may communicate with the outside world 
 *               and/or other lexer rules' actions in more or less complex ways.
 *
 *  }
 *
 *  Lexer.prototype: {
 *    EOF: 1,
 *    ERROR: 2,
 *
 *    yy:        The overall "shared context" object reference.
 *
 *    JisonLexerError: function(msg, hash),
 *
 *    performAction: function lexer__performAction(yy, yyrulenumber, YY_START),
 *
 *               The function parameters and `this` have the following value/meaning:
 *               - `this`    : reference to the `lexer` instance. 
 *                               `yy_` is an alias for `this` lexer instance reference used internally.
 *
 *               - `yy`      : a reference to the `yy` "shared state" object which was passed to the lexer
 *                             by way of the `lexer.setInput(str, yy)` API before.
 *
 *                             Note:
 *                             The extra arguments you specified in the `%parse-param` statement in your
 *                             **parser** grammar definition file are passed to the lexer via this object
 *                             reference as member variables.
 *
 *               - `yyrulenumber`   : index of the matched lexer rule (regex), used internally.
 *
 *               - `YY_START`: the current lexer "start condition" state.
 *
 *    parseError: function(str, hash, ExceptionClass),
 *
 *    constructLexErrorInfo: function(error_message, is_recoverable),
 *               Helper function.
 *               Produces a new errorInfo 'hash object' which can be passed into `parseError()`.
 *               See it's use in this lexer kernel in many places; example usage:
 *
 *                   var infoObj = lexer.constructParseErrorInfo('fail!', true);
 *                   var retVal = lexer.parseError(infoObj.errStr, infoObj, lexer.JisonLexerError);
 *
 *    options: { ... lexer %options ... },
 *
 *    lex: function(),
 *               Produce one token of lexed input, which was passed in earlier via the `lexer.setInput()` API.
 *               You MAY use the additional `args...` parameters as per `%parse-param` spec of the **lexer** grammar:
 *               these extra `args...` are added verbatim to the `yy` object reference as member variables.
 *
 *               WARNING:
 *               Lexer's additional `args...` parameters (via lexer's `%parse-param`) MAY conflict with
 *               any attributes already added to `yy` by the **parser** or the jison run-time; 
 *               when such a collision is detected an exception is thrown to prevent the generated run-time 
 *               from silently accepting this confusing and potentially hazardous situation! 
 *
 *    cleanupAfterLex: function(do_not_nuke_errorinfos),
 *               Helper function.
 *
 *               This helper API is invoked when the **parse process** has completed: it is the responsibility
 *               of the **parser** (or the calling userland code) to invoke this method once cleanup is desired. 
 *
 *               This helper may be invoked by user code to ensure the internal lexer gets properly garbage collected.

 *
 * The `parseError` function receives a 'hash' object with these members for lexer errors:
 *
 *  {
 *    text:        (matched text)
 *    token:       (the produced terminal token, if any)
 *    token_id:    (the produced terminal token numeric ID, if any)
 *    line:        (yylineno)
 *    loc:         (yylloc)
 *    recoverable: (boolean: TRUE when the parser MAY have an error recovery rule
 *                  available for this particular error)
 *    yy:          (object: the current parser internal "shared state" `yy`
 *                  as is also available in the rule actions; this can be used,
 *                  for instance, for advanced error analysis and reporting)
 *    lexer:       (reference to the current lexer instance used by the parser)
 *  }
 *
 * while `this` will reference the current lexer instance.
 *
 * When `parseError` is invoked by the lexer, the default implementation will
 * attempt to invoke `yy.parser.parseError()`; when this callback is not provided
 * it will try to invoke `yy.parseError()` instead. When that callback is also not
 * provided, a `JisonLexerError` exception will be thrown containing the error
 * message and `hash`, as constructed by the `constructLexErrorInfo()` API.
 *
 * Note that the lexer's `JisonLexerError` error class is passed via the
 * `ExceptionClass` argument, which is invoked to construct the exception
 * instance to be thrown, so technically `parseError` will throw the object
 * produced by the `new ExceptionClass(str, hash)` JavaScript expression.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * You can specify lexer options by setting / modifying the `.options` object of your Lexer instance.
 * These options are available:
 *
 * (Options are permanent.)
 *  
 *  yy: {
 *      parseError: function(str, hash, ExceptionClass)
 *                 optional: overrides the default `parseError` function.
 *  }
 *
 *  lexer.options: {
 *      pre_lex:  function()
 *                 optional: is invoked before the lexer is invoked to produce another token.
 *                 `this` refers to the Lexer object.
 *      post_lex: function(token) { return token; }
 *                 optional: is invoked when the lexer has produced a token `token`;
 *                 this function can override the returned token value by returning another.
 *                 When it does not return any (truthy) value, the lexer will return
 *                 the original `token`.
 *                 `this` refers to the Lexer object.
 *
 * WARNING: the next set of options are not meant to be changed. They echo the abilities of
 * the lexer as per when it was compiled!
 *
 *      ranges: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> token location info will include a .range[] member.
 *      flex: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> flex-like lexing behaviour where the rules are tested
 *                 exhaustively to find the longest match.
 *      backtrack_lexer: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> lexer regexes are tested in order and for invoked;
 *                 the lexer terminates the scan when a token is returned by the action code.
 *      xregexp: boolean
 *                 optional: `true` ==> lexer rule regexes are "extended regex format" requiring the
 *                 `XRegExp` library. When this %option has not been specified at compile time, all lexer
 *                 rule regexes have been written as standard JavaScript RegExp expressions.

     * 
     * This function is very useful to provide highly readable error reports, while
     * the location range may be specified in various flexible ways:
     * 
     * - `loc` is the location info object which references the area which should be
     *   displayed and 'marked up': these lines & columns of text are marked up by `^`
     *   characters below each character in the entire input range.
     * 
     * - `context_loc` is the *optional* location info object which instructs this
     *   pretty-printer how much *leading* context should be displayed alongside
     *   the area referenced by `loc`. This can help provide context for the displayed
     *   error, etc.
     * 
     *   When this location info is not provided, a default context of 3 lines is
     *   used.
     * 
     * - `context_loc2` is another *optional* location info object, which serves
     *   a similar purpose to `context_loc`: it specifies the amount of *trailing*
     *   context lines to display in the pretty-print output.
     * 
     *   When this location info is not provided, a default context of 1 line only is
     *   used.
     * 
     * Special Notes:
     * 
     * - when the `loc`-indicated range is very large (about 5 lines or more), then
     *   only the first and last few lines of this block are printed while a
     *   `...continued...` message will be printed between them.
     * 
     *   This serves the purpose of not printing a huge amount of text when the `loc`
     *   range happens to be huge: this way a manageable & readable output results
     *   for arbitrary large ranges.
     * 
     * - this function can display lines of input which whave not yet been lexed.
     *   `prettyPrintRange()` can access the entire input!
